# QUESTAO TEXTO

#### Impacts of new age technology

PARAGRAFO:1 New age technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have radically transformed the way banking works today. Thanks to AI, it is possible to conduct real-time data analysis from a large volume of data sets and provide customized solutions to banking customers.

PARAGRAFO:2 With powerful AI tools, banks can make informed decisions faster by using predictive analysis, which is the central point of AI and ML. As soon as a potential customer searches for something online, the AI tools pick it up and serve related content that leads to quick sales. This improves customer service tremendously as customers find tailor-made solutions without much human intervention.

PARAGRAFO:3 Banks’ lending processes have also improved considerably as they can analyze customers’ spending patterns, study different customer data points, and determine borrowers’ credit conditions. So, there is much less paperwork.

PARAGRAFO:4 Customer-centric banking has become indispensable with the introduction of different kinds of software that utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to read, process and understand text and speech. Banks have successfully installed digital tools to answer customer questions, which has helped them reduce the time and effort of human capital and provide quick and consistent service. Using those resources, banks are expected to save $7.3 billion in operational costs.

PARAGRAFO:5 The changing profile of banking depends a lot on the Internet-age generation. Their expectations from their banks to provide an omni-digital experience have enabled the shift, allowing them to fulfil their banking needs sitting from a remote location. Appropriately, banks quickly jumped onto the digitalization movement and refreshed their services in line with their requirements.

PARAGRAFO:6 Mobile banking, for example, is very popular among millennials. An Insider Intelligence’s Mobile Banking Competitive Edge study indicated that a surprising 97% of them use mobile banking! Transferring funds, checking their transactions online, downloading their account statements or even applying for a loan is possible through a click of fingers on their mobile phones. This has also eliminated the need for physical branches, enabling banks to operate in a lean manner and cut unnecessary costs.

PARAGRAFO:7 The usage of credit cards, debit cards, mobile banking apps, mobile wallets, third-party payment apps, etc., have all increased considerably, indicating an essential shift in the customers’ preferences. Banks have modernized their processes and broken the barriers between the different entities involved, such as branches, ATMs, and online banking, to create a continuous flow for their customers.

PARAGRAFO:8 The changing customer profile inclines towards bringing both physical and digital worlds closer, and this is influencing the finance and banking sector favorably. Banks give attention to this need for digitalization to retain their customers in the long run.

PARAGRAFO:9 The pandemic of Covid-19 helped the banking industry to depend heavily on digital technology and tech-enabled systems to stay alive. The result of the pandemic, however, resulted in new beginnings in the form of huge digital transformation and newer business models for the banks.

PARAGRAFO:10 The favorable impact of technology is obvious across banking institutions. Even though the banking arena has advanced in achieving digital involvement, many more unexploited opportunities exist for banks. The banks must maintain the sanctity of their customers’ data and serve them with better solutions without having to sacrifice their security. The few challenges the banking sector still has are data breaches or escapes, lack of e-banking knowledge amongst their customers, and the permanent technological landscape that requires constant training and updating. Plausible solutions to the above are available with a positive partnership between all stakeholders involved, such as government, industry professionals and, of course, different banking institutions.
