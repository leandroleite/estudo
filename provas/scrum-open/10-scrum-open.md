The three pillars uphold empirical and lean thinking: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
What are three incorrect, untrue, or misleading statements about Scrum?
X A. Scrum is a framework that eliminates complexity.
B. Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products.
X C. Scrum is a methodology where you can pick and choose which parts of Scrum you think will work for your environment.
X D. Scrum is like traditional processes but with self-organization to replace Project Managers.
E. Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.
F. Each component of Scrum serves a specific purpose and is essential to your ability to use Scrum to develop complex products.
Feedback
- Scrum is meant to be implemented as prescribed in the Scrum Guide. For example, the five events in the Scrum Guide are mandatory, each event has a specific purpose.
- Scrum does not eliminate the complexity that is inherent in delivering a product in today’s world, instead it offers a framework for dealing with complexity. By regularly delivering Increments of value teams gain the ability to inspect and rapidly adapt based on the feedback received.
- Project Managers are not simply replaced by self-managing teams. Scrum is a framework for optimizing decision making based on the knowledge and experience of the entire team.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. The Developers.
X B. The Product Owner and the Developers.
C. The Product Owner and all stakeholders.
D. The Scrum Master, the project manager, and the Developers
Feedback

The Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management. The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scrum has a role called "project manager."
True
X False
Feedback
A Scrum Team has a Scrum Master, a Product Owner and Developers. As a whole they have all controls needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When multiple Scrum Teams work together on the same product, each team should maintain a separate Product Backlog.
True
X False
Feedback
Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many Scrum Teams are used. Any other setup makes it difficult for the Developers to determine what they should work on.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Scrum Team consists of the following:
X A. Product Owner
X B. Developers

Feedback
Management has no official role or accountability on a Scrum Team. However, management external to the Scrum Team is relevant in setting the vision and strategy to guide the overall direction of the organization.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who should know the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to explain the alternatives most clearly?
A. The Developers
X B. The Product Owner

X C. The Developers have all the skills they need to create a valuable, useful Increment.
D. The Developers are working within the boundaries of their organization's functional description and nicely handing off work from analyst to developer to tester to integration.
E. The Developers are collaboratively selecting their own work during the Sprint.
F. The Developers create their own Sprint Backlog, reflecting all work that is required to meet the Definition of Done.
Feedback
The Daily Scrum is for the Developers. It should not be used by external stakeholders to check progress.
During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team should be crafting the Sprint Goal based on the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint. The Developers identify the necessary work to meet the Sprint Goal.
Scrum Team members do not have titles, and no sub-teams; such as testing, architecture, or operations are recognized. Accountability belongs with the Scrum Team as a whole, regardless of whether team members have specialized skills.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feedback
The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Scrum Team must choose at least one high priority process improvement item, identified during the Sprint Retrospective, and place it in the Sprint Backlog.
True
X False
Feedback
An earlier version of the Scrum Guide prescribed the practice of placing one improvement in the Sprint Backlog. This was removed in the 2020 update to the Scrum Guide because it was felt to be too prescriptive. However, if this practice provides value to you then you should adopt it. It is simply not prescribed anymore, but can still be valuable.

Who has the final say on the order of the Product Backlog?
A. The Developers.
X B. The Product Owner.
C. The Scrum Master.
D. The Stakeholders.
E. The CEO.
Feedback
