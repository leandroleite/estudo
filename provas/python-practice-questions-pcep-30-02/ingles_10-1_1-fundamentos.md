# QUESTAO NUMERO 6

Which of the following is true about Python?

- (A)  It is only a compiled language
- (B)  It is only an interpreted language
- (C)  It can be both compiled and interpreted
- (D)  It is neither compiled nor interpreted

## Explicação

Python is primarily an interpreted language, but it also uses a compilation step to bytecode. This allows Python to be both compiled (to bytecode) and interpreted, providing a balance of flexibility and performance.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 7

What is the main difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

- (A)  Interpreters are faster than compilers
- (B)  Compilers produce machine code, interpreters don't
- (C)  Interpreters can't handle complex programs
- (D)  Compilers are always free, interpreters are not

## Explicação

The main difference is that compilers translate the entire source code into machine code before execution, while interpreters execute the code line by line without producing machine code.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 8

In Python, what is responsible for converting source code into bytecode?

- (A)  The operating system
- (B)  The Python interpreter
- (C)  The user's text editor
- (D)  The Python compiler

## Explicação

In Python, the interpreter is responsible for converting source code into bytecode. This process happens automatically when a Python script is run.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 9

What is the correct order of steps in Python code execution?

- (A)  Lexical analysis, Parsing, Execution
- (B)  Parsing, Lexical analysis, Execution
- (C)  Execution, Lexical analysis, Parsing
- (D)  Lexical analysis, Execution, Parsing

## Explicação

The correct order is lexical analysis (breaking code into tokens), followed by parsing (analyzing the structure), and then execution.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 10

What does the Python interpreter do with syntax errors?

- (A)  Ignores them and continues execution
- (B)  Fixes them automatically
- (C)  Reports them and stops execution
- (D)  Compiles them into machine code

## Explicação

When the Python interpreter encounters a syntax error, it reports the error to the user and stops the execution of the program. This helps developers identify and fix issues in their code.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 11

Which of the following is part of Python's lexical structure?

- (A)  if-else statements
- (B)  Function definitions
- (C)  Keywords like 'for' and 'while'
- (D)  Class inheritance

## Explicação

Keywords like 'for' and 'while' are part of Python's lexical structure. They are fundamental building blocks (tokens) of the language recognized during lexical analysis.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 12

What does semantic analysis in Python primarily focus on?

- (A)  Spelling of variables
- (B)  Indentation of code
- (C)  Meaning and logical correctness of statements
- (D)  Speed of code execution

## Explicação

Semantic analysis in Python primarily focuses on the meaning and logical correctness of statements. It ensures that the code makes sense and follows the rules of the language beyond just syntax.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 13

Which phase of code processing deals with identifying tokens like keywords, identifiers, and operators?

- (A)  Semantic analysis
- (B)  Lexical analysis
- (C)  Parsing
- (D)  Code generation

## Explicação

Lexical analysis is the phase of code processing that deals with identifying tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and operators. It breaks down the source code into these fundamental elements.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 14

What is the main advantage of interpreted languages like Python?

- (A)  They always run faster than compiled languages
- (B)  They don't need a separate compilation step
- (C)  They use less memory
- (D)  They are more secure

## Explicação

The main advantage of interpreted languages like Python is that they don't need a separate compilation step. This allows for more immediate execution and easier debugging during development.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 15

In Python, what is the relationship between lexical analysis and syntax analysis?

- (A)  They are the same thing
- (B)  Lexical analysis comes after syntax analysis
- (C)  Lexical analysis comes before syntax analysis
- (D)  They are completely independent processes

## Explicação

In Python, lexical analysis comes before syntax analysis. Lexical analysis breaks the code into tokens, which are then used by the syntax analysis (parsing) to check the structural correctness of the code.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 16

What type of errors does syntactic analysis primarily detect?

- (A)  Runtime errors
- (B)  Logical errors
- (C)  Structural errors in the code
- (D)  Memory allocation errors

## Explicação

Syntactic analysis primarily detects structural errors in the code. These are errors that violate the grammar rules of the programming language, such as missing parentheses or incorrect indentation in Python.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 17

Which of the following is NOT a part of Python's semantic rules?

- (A)  Variable scope
- (B)  Type checking
- (C)  Code indentation
- (D)  Function return values

## Explicação

Code indentation is part of Python's syntax, not its semantic rules. While indentation is crucial in Python, it relates to the structure of the code rather than its meaning or logical correctness.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 18

What is the primary purpose of Python's bytecode?

- (A)  To make the code human-readable
- (B)  To optimize memory usage
- (C)  To provide a platform-independent representation of the program
- (D)  To encrypt the source code

## Explicação

The primary purpose of Python's bytecode is to provide a platform-independent representation of the program. This allows Python code to be run on different platforms without recompilation, as long as there's a Python interpreter available.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 19

In the context of Python, what does PVM stand for?

- (A)  Python Virtual Machine
- (B)  Portable Variable Manager
- (C)  Pre-compilation Verification Module
- (D)  Post-execution Variable Monitor

## Explicação

PVM stands for Python Virtual Machine. It's the runtime engine of Python that interprets the bytecode and actually runs the Python program.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 20

Which statement about Python's execution model is true?

- (A)  Python code is always compiled to machine code before execution
- (B)  Python uses a mix of interpretation and compilation (to bytecode)
- (C)  Python only uses pure interpretation without any compilation
- (D)  Python requires manual compilation by the programmer

## Explicação

Python uses a mix of interpretation and compilation. It first compiles the source code to bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

# QUESTAO NUMERO 21

What role does the lexer play in Python's code processing?

- (A)  It executes the code
- (B)  It breaks the input into tokens
- (C)  It checks for logical errors
- (D)  It optimizes the code

## Explicação

The lexer in Python's code processing breaks the input source code into tokens. These tokens are the smallest units of meaning in the language, such as keywords, identifiers, and operators.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 22

Which of the following is a semantic error in Python?

- (A)  Using a variable before declaring it
- (B)  Forgetting to close a parenthesis
- (C)  Using an undefined variable
- (D)  Misspelling a keyword

## Explicação

Using an undefined variable is a semantic error in Python. It relates to the meaning and logical correctness of the code, rather than its syntax or structure.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 23

What is the main difference between syntax and semantics in programming?

- (A)  Syntax deals with meaning, semantics with structure
- (B)  Syntax deals with structure, semantics with meaning
- (C)  They are the same thing
- (D)  Syntax is for compiled languages, semantics for interpreted languages

## Explicação

Syntax deals with the structure and grammar of the language, while semantics deals with the meaning of the statements. Syntax is about how you write the code, semantics is about what the code means.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 24

In Python, what happens immediately after lexical analysis?

- (A)  Code execution
- (B)  Semantic analysis
- (C)  Syntax analysis (parsing)
- (D)  Bytecode generation

## Explicação

In Python, immediately after lexical analysis comes syntax analysis, also known as parsing. This step checks if the sequence of tokens produced by the lexical analysis forms a valid structure according to the grammar rules of Python.

# QUESTAO NUMERO 25

Which of the following is true about Python's interpreter?

- (A)  It only checks for syntax errors
- (B)  It converts Python code directly to machine code
- (C)  It executes Python bytecode
- (D)  It is only used in the development phase, not in production

## Explicação

Python's interpreter executes Python bytecode. The source code is first compiled to bytecode, which is then executed by the interpreter (specifically, the Python Virtual Machine).
