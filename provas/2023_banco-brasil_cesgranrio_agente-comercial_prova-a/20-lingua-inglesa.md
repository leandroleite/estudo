Fed’s Jefferson says inflation is U.S. central bank’s most worrisome problem

PARAGRAFO:1 Inflation is the most serious problem facing the Federal Reserve and “may take some time” to address, Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said on Tuesday in his first public remarks since joining the U.S. central bank’s governing body.

PARAGRAFO:2 “Restoring price stability may take some time and will likely result in a period of below-trend growth,” Jefferson told a conference in Atlanta, joining the current Fed consensus for continued interest rate increases to battle price pressures.

PARAGRAFO:3 “I want to assure you that my colleagues and I are resolute that we will bring inflation back down to 2% ... We are committed to taking the further steps necessary.”

PARAGRAFO:4 Monetary policy that stabilizes inflation “can produce long-term, noninflationary economic expansions ... that economic history suggests is an ideal framework or environment for inclusive growth,” Jefferson said. “So, it is important that we get back to that kind of economy. And that is what I think the intent of the Fed is.”

PARAGRAFO:5 Fed Chair Jerome Powell has admitted that the central bank’s intent to slow economic growth will cause economic “pain” and likely increased unemployment, but that the worst outcome would be to let inflation take root.

PARAGRAFO:6 In his remarks, Jefferson said there are reasons to think rigid conditions in the labor market are already easing. Indeed new data on Tuesday showed a severe decrease in job openings in August that began to bring the number of workers sought by companies more in line with the numbers of unemployed.

PARAGRAFO:7 That could help reduce salary growth, Jefferson said, and there were indications as well that “supply bottlenecks have, finally, begun to resolve,” and could also help slow down price increases.

PARAGRAFO:8 But it remains uncertain how that will work, and in the meantime “inflation remains elevated, and this is the problem that concerns me most,” Jefferson said. “Inflation creates economic burdens for households and businesses, and everyone feels its effects.”
